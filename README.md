Hi! Welcome to my personal GitHub profile! 

My name is Kris Jackson. I'm a Computer Science major at Rhodes College seeking a full-time position in iOS Development or Software Engineering starting in the Fall of 2021. I have more than three years of professional programming experience, two years working with an outstanding team as co-founder of Netswitch LLC, and I have spent the last two summers working at Dell Technologies as a Machine Learning Intern.
