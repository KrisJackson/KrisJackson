# Kris Jackson

Hi! My name is Kris Jackson. I am a highly motivated and deeply passionate Computer Science major with a strong desire to build software that changes the world. As a Senior at Rhodes College, I am seeking a full-time position in Software Engineering starting in June of 2021. As an experienced programmer, I am interested in working for an organization that prioritizes personal growth, encourages creativity, allows the flexibility to take risks, and currently building the tools that define our world. I believe that leadership is not defined by followers, but by the ability to inspire and create more leaders. My long-term mission is to be a leader in the tech industry in hopes to one day take on techâ€™s biggest problems.<br/><br/>
