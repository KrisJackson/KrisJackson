  <h2>About Me</h2>
  
  <p> Hi there! My name is Kris Jackson. I am a Computer Science Major and Senior at Rhodes College, and this summer will be moving to New York City to begin my journey as a Software Development Engineer in Test at Peloton Interactive. I love to code, and I spend most of my free time developing random iOS applications that come to mind. The one thing that I love most about coding is having the ability to think of an idea and actually spending time bring that idea to life. </p> 
  
  <ul>
  Outside of programming, I love:
  <li> 🚴‍ Pelotoning 🚴‍ - I have yet to try the treadmill, but I really enjoy the bike.</li>
  <li> ☕️ Trying different coffees ☕️ - If you like coffee, I recommend joining Atlas Coffee Club.</li>
  <li> 📚 Reading 📚 - My favorite books are <i>Steve Jobs</i> by Walter Issacson, <i>The Ride of a Lifetime</i> by Bob Iger, and <i>Between the World and Me</i> by Ta-Nehisi Coates.</li>
  <li> 🎙 Listening to Podcasts 🎙 - My favorite podcasts are <i>Pivot</i> by New York Magazine, <i>The Vergecast</i> by the Verge, and <i>Decoder with Nilay Patel</i> by the Verge.</li>
  <li> 🎧 Listening to Classic Hip-Hop 🎧 - I absolutley love hip-hop. My favorite artists are Jay-Z, Eminem, Kanye West, Notorious B.I.G, and Lauryn Hill.</li>
</ul>
